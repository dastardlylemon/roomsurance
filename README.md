Roomsurance
==========
Ever had trouble dealing with roommates that simply would not wash their dishes or clean their mess? Roomsurance aims to be the final solution to all your problems.

Using PHP and JS, we've created a web application that'll use a point system to keep track of all the chores you and your roommates have been assigned. At the beginning, you and your roommates will deposit a mutually agreed sum of money. You can then start creating tasks and assign them to people. Each task has a point value that you and your roommates decide upon. If the person to whom task is assigned to dutifully does their chore, then we have no problems. However, people can steal a roommates chores to gain points for themselves! If the person to whom the chore is assigned to does not fulfill their task before the due date, and somebody else does it for them, the person that was originally assigned the chore will lose the point value of the chore while the one who did it will gain their points! At the very end, the total sum of money contributed to the pot will be distributed according to the final point value of each roommate.

The competition for points, Roomsurance. Do your chores, or prepare to pay up.
